This is a daily task planner app for putting into practice what I have learned about NodeJS (+ ExpressJS), MongoDB and ReactJS (+ Redux). I wanted to have a private place for me to login in (based on PassportJS) and organize my days individually.

The front end was developed using material desing (https://material-ui.com/).
